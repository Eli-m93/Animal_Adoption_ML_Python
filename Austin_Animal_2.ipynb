    "- This project was inspired by a [mini-course on decision trees from AWS](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-dte).\n",

    "# Context\n",
    " \n",
    "The Austin Animal Shelter (AAS) takes in thousands of animals every year, yet transfers or rehomed 90%+ of the animals coming in. As a no kill shelter, AAS has a strong incentive to ensure all animals have a chance at finding a new home. With so many animals moving in and out of the shelter it would be beneficial for staff to get a daily update on which animals in the shelter would have a higher or lower chance of rehomed.  While staff have deep domain expertise, latent relationships between animal characteristics could be looked over in assigning probabilities of being rehomed. \n",
    " \n",
    "This project attempts to assign probabilities of rehoming for animals coming into the shelter. To do this I use income/outcome data from AAS, updated daily, to build multiple models to assign rehome probability to all animals. The hope is that staff would receive a daily report with all animals in their shelter with their propylites. Animals with high probabilities would be treated as business as usual - they would still benefit from staff attention, adoption events, etc... Animals with low probability could be promoted with free adoption fee's, highlights on their splash screen, or active outreach to find the animal a home.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Summary of Approach/Results\n",
    " \n",
    "To build this model I take AAS's outcome types:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Adopted: The animal is adopted by a family\n",
    "- Return to Owner: The animal is given back to the original owner\n",
    "- Transfer: The animal is sent to a partner shelter\n",
    "- Other: The animal passes away, is lost, or is put down for outstanding reasons.\n",
    " \n",
    "I take rehomed as being adopted or returned to their owner. With this metric in mind, I use available features to build a prediction of probabilities. As AAS rehomes most of their animals (~65%) I recognize a slightly imbalanced data and use ROC-AUC scoring to try to find a model that combats such lopsidedness. In the end I use a random forest classifier to predict future animals brought in. \n",
    " \n",
    "I find a AUC score of 0.81, a balanced accuracy rate (using a 0.5 threshold) of 78%, and a accuracy rate of 81%. This constitutes as an improvement of ~70% over a dummy classifier that predicts being rehomed. "
