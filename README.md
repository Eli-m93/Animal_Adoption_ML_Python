# Animal_Adoption_ML_Python
Personal project that attempts to use tree based methods to predict if animals get adopted within 30 days in a shelter.

Attached is a mini-project I started that attempts to predict if an animal taken in from Austin animal shelter will be re-homed in 30 days. I did this to better understand Tree + Ensemble methods in Sklearn.

- This project was inspired by a [mini-course on decision trees from AWS](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-dte). 
- Raw data is taken from [The City of Austin Texas's government data page](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm).

This project is ongoing, please excuse any grammatical mistakes or unfinished parts!

### Ongoing goals to add (As of 4/13/22):
1. Pull data via SODA API or create local SQL server to perform pulls. Problematic as SODA API won't let me pull "max rows."
2. Attempt other ensemble methods. Ideally ADA boosted trees and NN (when I master this).
3. Finish with fine tuning and assessing over test set.
4. Create final table of results + takeaways.
5. Expand on EDA, clean up as part of presentation to Austin Shelter team.
